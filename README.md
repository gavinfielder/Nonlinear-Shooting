# The nonlinear shooting project



This program solves 2nd order nonlinear boundary value problems using the shooting method. See documentation for details on the numerical implementation.



Also packaged in this repo is a smaller program for linear shooting, and one that uses Euler's method instead of Runge-Kutta.
